### What is SubPaper?

SubPaper is an Android app designed to bring high-quality wallpapers directly from Reddit to your device.

The purpose of this project is to provide high-quality, user-rated wallpapers for Android devices. It curates these wallpapers from various subreddits on Reddit, offering a diverse collection that caters to different tastes.

SubPaper has been developed to be light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source SubReddit saved in Firebase Realtime Database.

This project has been built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework, which allows to build an app for mobile, desktop & web, from a single codebase.
